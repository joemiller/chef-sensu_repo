sensu repo base dir
===================

Welcome to "<%= @node.sensu_repo.base_dir %>".

This is the base directory of the Sensu yum/apt repos. Everything involving
repo management happens from here!

Chef
----
Much of this directory is managed by the `sensu_repo` cookbook.

User
----
There is a special system user '<%= @node.sensu_repo.user %>' responsible for managing
the repos. This is also his home directory.

Important Directories and Files
-------------------------------
The directory structure is:

*   freight/    - Staging area for freight, the apt repo tools.
*   html/       - This is the doc root for the yum and apt repos. It could be
                  served directly from this server, but we'll sync it to
                  S3.
*   scripts/    - Helpers scripts for managing the repos. See below.
*   .gnupg/     - Contains the '<%= @node.sensu_repo.user %>' user's GPG keys
                  used for signing packages.

Other important files outside of this directory:

    /etc/freight.conf   - Config file for freight.
